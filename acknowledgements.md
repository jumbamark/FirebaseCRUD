   - **Error Handling:** Valuable insights on error handling in Firestore operations ensured robust error management within the `createInventory` function.

#### 2. `getInventory` Function
   - **Querying Data:** Understanding the proper usage of queries from the documentation facilitated the implementation of the `getInventory` function.
   - **Code Clarity:** Guidelines on structuring queries for retrieving inventory data enhanced the readability and clarity of the code.

#### 3. `updateInventory` Function
   - **Updating Data:** The documentation provided step-by-step guidance on updating documents in Firestore, significantly influencing the `updateInventory` function's implementation.
   - **Best Practices:** Following the best practices outlined in the documentation ensured a reliable integration with Firebase Firestore, leading to efficient updates.

#### 4. `deleteInventory` Function
   - **Deleting Data:** Comprehensive documentation on deleting documents from Firestore influenced the implementation of the `deleteInventory` function.
   - **Code Efficiency:** Insights from the documentation enhanced the efficiency of the deletion process within `deleteInventory`.

By leveraging the official Firebase documentation, each inventory-related function's implementation became more straightforward, reliable and aligned with Firebase best practices.
